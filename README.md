(current constraint: For the sake of simplicity in the market structure, there is only one stock per company. And the stock price is static)

This is a simple web application built with Flask micro framework.

SQLAlchemy database toolkit is used for storing the data of the the application.

User register is maintained in the data base and matches with new logins.

Whole of the application is built while learning Flask Micro-Frame work.
